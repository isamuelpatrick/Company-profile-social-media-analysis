1. Don't keep multiple bank accounts.
Choose one or two financial partners, like Stanbic IBTC, that can help your business. 

2. SMEs need to learn to draw the line between their personal income and their business income
3. Focus on your core business. Financial institutions want to know that funds will be used for what your business is about.

Yes, it‚Äôs that simple and seamless! You should also note that Voluntary Contributions could be any amount of your choice, it could be as little as N1,000, as long it is from your legitimate income and not more than 1/3 of your monthly salary, in line with the Labour Act, 1990.
You are eligible to withdraw only 50% of your VC as long as the contributions have been retained in the account for at least 2 years. Subsequent withdrawals will be made after 2 years from the last withdrawal date. That is, if your last withdrawal date was January 2017, your next withdrawal date would be anytime from February 2019.

Speaking of the future, let us talk about Wills. A Will is a legal document that sets out who you want to receive your assets when you pass on. You can choose to write a simple Will or a comprehensive Will.

02/04/2019,10:41 AM,LinkedIn,Photo, ,"Reasons for estate planning are:
1. Inevitability of death: With healthcare services not as they should be, death rate among young Nigerians is on the rise. It would be unwise to die without a will.
2. Secure future for children: Many have died without a plan thereby forcing their children to leave school or be left to a relative who may feel pressured by the responsibility. Such children could turn to crime for survival.
3. Bitter litigation: When someone dies intestate, family members often lay claims on the person‚Äôs estate which may lead to legal disputes. Such disputes may lead to deaths and break up of families. It is therefore imperative to spare members of the family the pain of litigation and enmity by having a Will.
4. Lengthy probate: Probate is the legal certification of the validity of a Will. It is a process through which a Will must pass to ensure its validity. A probate can be difficult, but without a will, it could be demanding of time, effort, and money of loved ones. A Will ‚Äúensures that the assets are distributed according to express wishes.‚Äù
The requirements for a legacee are simple. Once a person attains adulthood, and plans on having a family, the plan allows him secure the future of his loved ones. To learn more, call 01-2706800.","1,782","1,782",2.69%,48,26,26,0,6,0.90%,16,16,0,0,0

26/03/2019,10:22 AM,LinkedIn,Photo, ,"Nkechi came home from a visit to her friend Bidemi, who had just lost her husband. Her in-laws had come to ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù what to do with ‚Äútheir late brother‚Äôs property‚Äù. But it was clear that they had taken a decision before coming and were only there to pass on instructions. They instructed her to move out of the mansion in Ikeja where she lived into a smaller house  owned by the late husband. 
Nkechi shared this with her husband, and advised him to write his Will, as this would ensure a protected legacee for herself and their children. Like many, they had never thought about estate planning before and reasoned that such exercise is performed at old age. While she insisted, her husband got angry and accused her of wishing him premature death. 
This is a typical reaction by Nigerians when there‚Äôs a mention of legacee. It is likened to slapping one‚Äôs parents. Unfortunately, death is inevitable and the earlier one confronts his mortality, the better the quality of life for him and his family. Leaving a legacee requires a cautious attempt at estate planning and deploying such financial tools like a Trust. However, there are those who have no qualms about death but who are still passive regarding estate planning. To know more about Legacee, call 01-2706800.

Zaynab had  a balance of N4,850,000 in her pension account at the time she passed away. What do you think will happen to this balance?  Options below, please reply with your answer or quote. 
 
1.    It is paid to the next of kin stated in the records she has with her chosen PFA.
2.    Once the PFA becomes aware of her demise, it will be transferred to her bank account by word of mouth.
3.   Her PFA gets to keep the money, even when they are aware that the account holder has died.
4.    The funds are paid to the beneficiaries stated on her will or letter of administration.

Congenital amputation can be a devastating experience for both the parents and child. It comes with adjustments no one plans for and realities that can be hard to accept. Here are a few thoughts we have on being there for a child who may need you:

1. Emotional support: Everyone does better when they know they are loved, especially children. This is the first and most important thing a child needs. 
2. Psychological support: It may be too much to cope with even as a parent or guardian, but you must remember to teach them to believe in their abilities, regardless of what has happened 
3. Physical support: Ensure to get them the right prosthesis for their age and the medical care they need ‚Äì dedicated physiotherapy usually helps. It is also important that you show them how to do things themselves.

Hypertension is a health condition in which blood pressure is persistently elevated putting undue stress on the heart, blood vessels and other organs. In 9 of 10 cases, the cause of hypertension cannot be identified. However, certain factors such as ‚Äì Hereditary, Environmental, Lifestyle (weight, diet, alcohol, smoking, physical inactivity and medication) are considered contributory. It is often referred to as the ‚Äòsilent killer‚Äô because it can exist with no obvious symptoms. The only way to detect it is by monitoring your blood pressure. Blood pressure is not a fixed number. It varies with physical activity, excitement, time of day or night, and with emotional factors. This is why it is important to have your blood pressure taken under proper conditions and regularly. The higher the blood pressure, the greater the cardiovascular risk. The longer the duration of hypertension, the greater the cardiovascular risk. #WealthWednesday

In the event that your car isn‚Äôt insured and the comprehensive policy is looking very pricey ‚Äì you have an option: Third Party Insurance. Ask us how we can help!¬†5. Remember this: Your insurer is liable for the repair of the third party‚Äôs car since you can also make a claim on where you are responsible for the damage.¬† Group Life Insurance: If you are an employer with up to three staff, it is also compulsory to have a group life insurance policy in place.

Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are both general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development, characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviours.
Autism is a complex neurobehavioral condition that includes impairments in social interaction, developmental language and communication skills combined with rigid, repetitive behaviours.¬†

18/04/2018,3:28 PM,LinkedIn,Text, ,"So here are some strategies for promoting language development in nonverbal children and adolescents with autism:
1. Encourage play and social interaction - Children learn through play, and that includes learning language. Interactive play provides enjoyable opportunities for you and your child to communicate. Try a variety of games to find those your child enjoys.
2. Imitate your child - Mimicking your child‚Äôs sounds and play behaviours will encourage more vocalizing and interaction. It also encourages your child to copy you and take turns.
3. Focus on nonverbal communication - Gestures and eye contact can build a foundation for language. Encourage your child by modelling and responding these behaviours.

18/04/2018,3:30 PM,LinkedIn,Photo, ,"More strategies for promoting language development in non-verbal children and adolescents with autism:
4. Leave ‚Äúspace‚Äù for your child to talk - It‚Äôs natural to feel the urge to fill in language when a child doesn‚Äôt immediately respond. But it‚Äôs so important to give your child lots of opportunities to communicate, even if he isn‚Äôt talking.	
5. Simplify your language - Doing so helps your child follow what you‚Äôre saying. It also makes it easier for her to imitate your speech.	
6. Follow your child's interests - Rather than interrupting your child‚Äôs focus, follow along with words. Using the one-up rule, narrate what your child is doing.
7. Consider assistive devices and visual supports - Assistive technologies and visual supports can do more than take the place of speech. They can foster its development. #WealthWednesday

Are you making yourself wealthy or just earning an income?

Have you ever wondered how some sports stars become broke despite making millions during their careers? It‚Äôs because wealth is not measured by the amount of money that comes into one‚Äôs pocket, but by the amount that stays there.

Building your wealth requires some self-discipline and deliberate actions.You need to save and invest to create wealth. Those are the actions required. The main idea behind investing is to put the money you‚Äôve saved into things you think will go up or at least maintain value over time. What kind of things? You may be asking- things like stocks, bonds and real estate. The trick is to buy an asset when the price is low, then try to sell when the price is high. That‚Äôs how you make a profit.

This can be done either on your own or through a professional financial adviser who would invest on your behalf and give you steady income on your investment.

Your voluntary contributions are also treated as such, thus helping you to legitimately save on taxes as you save more towards retirement.

It involves collection of money from various retail investors and then buying wholesale investments on their behalf and sharing the returns amongst the participants in line with their investment amounts. Remember how Mumsy used to collabo with a group of friends to buy foodstuffs from the market in bulk, and then they‚Äôd split amongst themselves to save cost and get better quality foodstuff?

07/03/2018,3:50 PM,LinkedIn,Photo, ,"Just like a banker will offer a better rate to a depositor with N5,000,000 than to one with N100,000. Mutual funds remind us that we can come together so that our N100,000 earns like returns with the N5,000,000. Everyone brings what they have, N5,000, N10,000, N1m and the money together forms a pool of cash that can be invested. These funds are then managed by a Fund Manager like Stanbic IBTC Asset management who makes all the investment decisions. One of the benefits you get is having access to returns from the total amount in the fund alongside all the other investors. So all you do is put your money in, and watch it grow as you earn returns on your investment. Mutual funds are also open-ended, that means you do not have to wait till a specific time to get your money out. Also, your investment is liquid (easily converted to cash) at any time you need it. Sounds good right? #WealthWednesday

Beyond the fact that making pension contributions is compulsory in Nigeria, these contributions serve as a great place to start planning towards that retirement you deserve. The best advice is to become more deliberate about contributing towards your pension. So here are a few tips on how to make this happen. 
- Monitor your account: There are several easy options to help you monitor the inflows into your pension account. Monitoring helps you determine if the contributions into your account are consistent and adequate to fund the retirement you dream of. #WealthWednesday",18,18,150%,27,26,26,0,1,0%,0,0,0,0,0

It is also a good time to plan for the New Year.

But they were not really sure what their best options were. Jude‚Äôs friends were suggesting all sorts and he got really confused. Luckily, his wife knew just the right thing to do!
